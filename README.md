# Path of Exile 2 Launches exactly December 12th

### Day 1
Shouldnt be using modular arithmetics on negative numbers (maybe im just doing it wrong)

### Day 2
Very happy with the `create_pattern` function. Sometimes (always) taking out pen and paper helps with achieving these kind of solutions. Also very pleased to do some programming and puzzle solving in this LLM era.

### Day 3
Nothing too fancy.

### Day 4
Directions and padding.

### Day 5
I hate intervals.

### Day 6
Had to change split() for splitlines()

### Day 7
Overthought the solution with DFS, just simple solution from bottom up

### Day 8
This took a while, bit stubborn for not calculating all distances beforehand. Afterwards is just set joining.

### Day 9
Key was to check if the edges are contained in the rectangle. Code has too high complexity $O(n^3)$ and took 3 hours to run. I was very lucky that the result was correct.

### Day 10
(Part 2) Recursive solution is implemented (works on example) but complexity is too high. Linear algebra's approach is tough, didn't do that much linalg even in my math bachelors.

Will try to solve it one day, there are some stuff in scipy that might help.

### Day 11
Simple dfs + lru_cache, since no input was designed to have no loops.

### Day 12
